    "The financial ratios used for forecasting include the followings:\n",
    "- **Cash holdings ratio**: A higher cash holdings ratio generally indicates that a company has a strong liquidity position, which can provide a cushion during economic downturns or unexpected expenses. However, excessively high cash holdings might also signify inefficiency in utilizing resources for investment or growth.\n",
    "- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: ROA indicates how efficiently a company utilizes its assets to generate profits. A higher ROA signifies better asset utilization and management, indicating that the company is more effective in converting its assets into profits.\n",
    "- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: ROE reflects a company's ability to generate profits from the shareholders' investments. A higher ROE indicates that the company is generating more profit per unit of shareholders' equity, making it more attractive to potential investors.\n",
    "- **Asset Turnover**: Asset turnover shows how many dollars of revenue a company generates for each dollar of assets it holds. A higher asset turnover suggests that the company is using its assets efficiently to generate sales.\n",
    "- **Debt Ratio**: The debt ratio helps assess a company's leverage and financial risk. A lower debt ratio indicates that the company relies less on debt financing and is considered less risky, while a higher debt ratio implies greater reliance on debt, which may increase financial vulnerability in challenging economic conditions."
